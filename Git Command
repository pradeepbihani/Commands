Fist We have to initiate the Git 
1.Go to the following folder to whome you want to commit
#git init ---(this will creat .git folder in the following folder which will trak all the git releated things)

#git status ---> (to check which file we have add to git track) and which are not)
will trak change in file not just a file

# git add   ----> (to add file on the git track it will just track the file whether it has changed or not)

if you hava modified file after adding the file on git track then git status will show that file is not stagged for commit
show to update the thetrack we have to again add file to git (git add file_name)

# git commit ----> git comit will commit the changes which you have done and will ask to write something about the commit 

#git commit -m 'Added The Licence' 

#vim .gitignore  --->list all the file and folder to whome you want to ignore

#git diff file_name ---> show the difference between file you modified wrt to stagging area
#git diff --staged/--cached file_name --> show the difference between file in stagged area and commited area

#git log  ---> Will show the History of the Git whatever you have done
#git log --stats ---> will give more information about the no of lines
#git log --oneline ---> will provide less information
#git log --graph ---> to get to know more about the branches

#git branch  ---> give information about the branches you have(star before the branch name indicate that you are in that branch)
#git branch branch_name   --- > create the branch with the branch_name 
#git checkout branch_name ---->  will move you in the branch_name branch

#git remote add origin https://github.com/pradeepbihani/Commands.git
#git push -u origin master
